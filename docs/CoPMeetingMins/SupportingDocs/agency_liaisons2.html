<title>liaisons version 2</title>
</head><body>

<h2>Planned update(s)</h2>
<p>This page was a planned update to the liaisons list. The planned differences will be reading the liaisons from a json file, and also giving the web browser the option to select which programming language formatted (sorted) the liaison's json data.</p>

<p>Web browser selection was to be as fair as possible among a set of companies which developed the languages. Minimizing preferences will cause more programming effort, so the success is to be determined (TBD).</p>

<p>
The languages from companies were run on the local computer then uploaded to GitHub. This was as opposed to integrating the code into a web page as advertised by the [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/) effort. Web Assembly was not understood well enough at this time so not attempted. Some JavaScript maybe added to retrieve files though.</p>
