# README - liaisons.json.draft

## Status

The existing liaisons.md file was reformatted to JSON and some modifications attempted.

## investigate new columns
Some new columns or json objects investigated for the reasons below.

Offboarding:

An offboarding column / object was a reference for maintaining the liaison contact to the extent there was interest. If a liaison entered into retirement, retaining an offboarding procedure might help clear their name and email address. If not cleared, an undelivered message could be returned to someone in the public who tried to message. It was assumed a Federal agent trying to inquire about a code.json would receive the same undelivered message.

A source code program [policy file](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf) dated 2016 had a paragraph for a 3 year pilot program. It was not known if the program was continuing or to what extent it had been abandoned. So the offboarding might include any internet articles communicating status.

repos column:
A guess was an agency could delegate part of the code.json to a version control system (VCS), a repo, if that repo supplied a JSON. If a potential VCS was observed, a link might be entered here. 


## Messy personal software files and rules broken

Some personal cryptic or message software and files may exist. These could accidentally break rules the following rules:
	Where the GitHub service was only for coordinating professional files and not backing up cryptic personal notes, the use may be imperfect. The risk of loosing files and code was mitigated by their inclusion. An "rm -rf" accident was done and loss occurred, so a change to include messy files was to recover better.
	An incomplete effort does not meet the hope of completed product. A variety of programming languages was run separate while not being trained to apply the [Web Assembly, WASM](https://webassembly.org/) project. As able and as time allows, languages from several companies and organizations may be coded to minimize the perception of having favorites.
	A verse, Luke 14:30, was not used in the original context back in the day. The verse talked about an incomplete project, but way back them there were not incomplete computer programming, pending memory safety, or WASM. So use of the verse for processing liaisons and learning WASM is imperfect. The use is a file extension of .l14, reminding of Luke 14, for a fractional HTML file. Reference 1 indicated no preparations for a better file-name occurred.
