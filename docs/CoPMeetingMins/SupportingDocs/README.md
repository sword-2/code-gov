# README - liaisons.json.draft

## Status

The existing liaisons.md file is being manually reformatted to JSON to eventually read it into a web page and sort columns, to understand inventories better. The current markdown format was not known to sort on a column. Under construction.

Investigation on new columns:

Some new columns were added to this informal draft as explained below.

Offboarding:

An offboarding column may be added in the future as an option for individual liaisons. An individual liaison could eventually leave for any number of reasons, for example, entry into retirement. If a liaison entered into retirement, an offboarding procedure might have a step to clear the old email address from the list of liaisons. That was to prevent an undeliverable message being returned to someone in the public or Federal agent inquiring about a code.json.

A source code program [policy file](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf) dated 2016 had a paragraph for a 3 year pilot program. It was not known if the program was continuing or to what extent it had been abandoned. The offboarding might include any internet articles found for status for continuing or abandoning.

repos column:
It was possible an agency could switch to letting a version control system (VCS), a repo, inventory a lot of their code.json. No way to know if this was a plan, but if a potential VCS was observed, a link might be entered into a repos column. Even if the VCS was not a plan for continuing with a code.json, a public reader might check the link to browse any known code.
